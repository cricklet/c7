A game, featuring major 7ths

Trying to eliminate state:
 - Instance vars must be declared in the constructor
 - Other instance vars (i.e. memoizing) should be this._asdf
 - No global variables with state
 - Only constant global variables
 - Most computation will be done through stateless functions
 - Use Backbone.Events to communicate with parent
