Learning how to do audio in Javascript and experimenting with some design principles:
 - Instance vars must be declared in the constructor
 - Other instance vars (i.e. memoizing) should be this._asdf
 - No global variables with state
 - Only constant global variables
 - Most computation will be done through stateless functions
 - Use Backbone.Events to communicate with parent
